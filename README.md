Doesn't yet fully work on Windows touch devices or on Firefox.


TODO
====

Place the ghost correctly when scrolled down.

Namespace all events.

Add way to removing (turn off) for a given DOM element.

Ensure it works with elements of differing heights.

on desktop chrome, the browser animation makes it look like the change didn't work, even though it did.
